I’m writing this weekly retro from my couch using a new setup on my phone. More on that below. I’ve got the LSU women’s basketball game on the TV and it's snowing outside. I’ll have to shovel later. 

Minneapolis and Minnesota are still under occupation by ICE and other various federal agents. There’s been an attempt to change the narrative: Bovino is out Homan is here, but nothing has really changed. At one of Homan’s first press conferences after he was brought in, he referred to the city I live and work in as a theater. As in a military theater of war. 

Just this morning [federal agents threw chemical irritants at people observing them at a local park](https://bsky.app/profile/jchavezmpls.bsky.social/post/3mdsn7etdmk2t), people are still being kidnapped, some of those are being [held at the Whipple Federal building in horrible conditions](https://bsky.app/profile/jchavezmpls.bsky.social/post/3mdsn7etdmk2t), then released hours or days later into the woods around the building or dumped at a nearby rail station. It’s cruel, heartless, and pointless. 

On a more personal level, I’ve managed to maintain a semblance of normality: getting out of bed, logging on to work from home, or even commute, but I feel empty, scooped out. At work I sit in meetings trying to care about the software my team produces for a MN-based company that has remained largely silent and aloof about all of this, other than [our CEO signing a bland, empty letter along with other CEOs](https://www.mprnews.org/story/2026/01/25/minnesota-ceos-issue-joint-letter-urging-deescalation-in-minnesota-after-shooting). 

I’ve managed to keep my Peloton streak this week, and hit day 30 this week. My rides this week were a low-impact ride, a power zone ride, and a 45-minute power zone endurance ride. I filled in the additional days with meditation and stretching. Next week I’ll try to sprinkle in some strength training. 

I have an appointment with a doctor this week to talk about this pain I’ve been feeling in my left pectoral muscle (see how many words I used to avoid saying chest pain). I’m also hoping we can discuss a primary care plan and set up a cadence for check-ups, screenings, etc. 

I didn’t play a single board or card game this week. What will help is deciding on the list of games I want to bring to the table. I’ve got ideas, but it will help to make the list. I’m a very list-driven person. I’ll also probably need to dedicate a day or two each week to play the games. My default ways to spend free time is video gaming or reading, and that’s what I’ve largely been doing. 

I don’t have any updates on the AT Protocol front either. I’ve been focused on getting this site designed, built, and published and there’s still work to be done. I’ve got the blog part worked out, as well as the home and about pages. There are a few other pages and features I want to add though. 

The new setup I’m trying is a combination of [Working Copy](https://workingcopy.app/) and [IA Writer](https://ia.net/) on my phone. Working Copy allows me to connect to the GitLab repo where the sites source code and content is stored. IA Writer allows me to write entries on my phone. I’m hoping this will allow me to write as the idea strikes me, make notes throughout the week, and update the site from anywhere. It occurs to me that I'll probably want to add some kind of draft status for posts so I can switch from phone to desktop and vice-versa. More to-dos!

## Things I enjoyed this week
- [Tom Morrello getting the crowd to sing the lyrics to "Killing in the Name"](https://bsky.app/profile/stribgoingout.startribune.com/post/3mdnzqhyen22r) at his First Ave show, a fundraiser for the families of Renee Good and Alex Pretti.
- I'm a huge fan of British crime dramas, and for years I've heard about ["Prime Suspect" starring Hellen Mirren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Suspect). It's finally on streaming services, and it's as good as advertised.
- Every year, Lynn Fisher redesigns her website, and this year she added a "bounce" effect that is simply joyful. Check out [her post on the redesign](https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/case-study-2025-refresh/) and resize your browser window to see the effect in action. So fun!
